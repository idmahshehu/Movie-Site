# Movie-Site

This project's a simple movie-site where the frontend it's more in focus than the backend. 
I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. The project's not been completed by the backend. 
PHP it's used simply just to retrieve/save data from/on the database for login, register, and for some texts, and not for all data, so it has more static data on it. About the frontend I have used HTML to create the structure, CSS to style it up and Javascript to validate my login, register, slider and make my category list.
