              Creed III is an upcoming American sports drama film directed by
              Michael B. Jordan (in his feature directorial debut) with a
              screenplay by Keenan Coogler and Zach Baylin from a story they
              co-wrote with Ryan Coogler. This is the first film in the franchise
              without Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, though he still serves
              as a producer for his Balboa Productions banner. Creed III is
              scheduled to be released by United Artists Releasing in the United
              States and Warner Bros. Pictures internationally on March 3, 2023.
